How to proceed
============

#. **Copy the folder with your network configuration files into the SMALL_NETWS folder.**
#. **Copy the control configuration files into sim_1/cc/Control_Param_Files**
#. **Set the parameters for your simulation by editing *Dsu_1.py* located in sim_1/cc/**
#. **Run the simulation: *python3.4 Simulation.py*.**
#. **A new folder is created in which you'll find a file called *file_recording_event_db.txt*.**
	This is the file containing all the data about the simulation. It is the file we will upload on the website to analyze the results.
