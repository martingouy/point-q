This is the signification if each column of any line recored by the ``.Q''.

\begin{enumerate}
\item the event time
\item the event type
\item the id of the intersection node
\item the type of the intersection node, (signalised or not)
\item the list with the $[t\_start,t\_duration]$ for each intersection control matrix for the next cycle
\item margin time to computs the intersection control matrix for the next cycle. If the current cycle finishes at t\_fin, then the new network control matrix, should be calculated at t\_fin- margin\_dt.
\item the time at which the current  intersection control starts
\item the duration of the current intersection control
\item the current intersection control matrix
\item the current network intersection matrix for the associated link 
\item the duration of the current cycle
\item the vehicle id
\item the time at which the vehicle appeared in the the network
\item the id of the entry link at which the associated vehicle appeared
\item the id of the link where the vehicle is currently located
\item the time at which the vehicle arrived at the current link
\item the time at which the vehile started its departure from the current link
\item the time at which the vehile left the current link
\item the current queue location of th evehicle (in the form of (l,m))
\item the type of the queue (right turn or other)
\item the time at which the vehicle arrived at the current queue
\item the time at which a vehicle started its departure from the current queue
\item the time at which the vehicle left the current queue
\item the id of the destination link of the vehicle when leaving the current link
\item the time at which the vehicle left the network
\item the id of the link associated with the current event
\item the answer $1$ or $0$ indicating if the vehicle can leave the queue by its arrrival or not
\item the time at which the vehicle will arrive at the next link or queue (this is for verifying the calculations)
\item the currently achieved service rate of the queue where the vehicle is, including the vehicle (case when the vehicle can leave the queue)
\item the current value of the service rate of the queue where the vehicle is located
\item a list with the ids of the vehicles in the associated queue with this event
\item the list of the network control matrices decided during the event Ev\_end\_decision\_network\_control, for the next cycle 
\item the ncm chosen by mp control 
\item the number of departing vehicle within an end veh hold at que event or with the ev end veh dep
\item matrix OD
\item the nb of vehicles in the arrival  link
\item the nb of veh in the depart. link
\item the id of the veh final destination (when the model  decides it by the veh appearance) (exit link)
\item variable returning the type of control , $0$ if the ctrl is RC, $1$ sinon
\item variable indicating the current values od the turn ratios of the intersection
\item variable indicating the new estimated values of the  turn ratios
\item variable indicating the cum values of the new estim turn ratios
\item variable indicating the current estimated values of the turn ratios (before replaced by the new estimated ones)
\item variable indicating the  time at which finishes the current intersection control
\item the id of the actuated staged  by a new control
\item variable indicating the current cummulative values (not empoyed at all and saoul dbe deleted this variable as well some others).
